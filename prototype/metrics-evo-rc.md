Evolution Repository: https://github.com/chaoss/wg-evolution

Scope: Aspects related to how the source code changes over time, and the mechanisms that the project has to perform and control those changes.

### Focus Area - Code Development

**Goal:**  
Activity - Learn about activity involved in changing (or adding) code.  
Question: How many **changes** are happening to the source code, during a certain time period?  

<div>
<table>
  <thead><tr><th>Metric</th><th>Question</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
  <tr><td><a href="https://chaoss.community/metric-code-changes/">Code Changes</a></td><td>What changes were made to the source code during a specified period?</td></tr>
  <tr><td><a href="https://chaoss.community/metric-code-changes-lines">Code Changes Lines</a></td><td>What is the sum of the number of lines touched (lines added plus lines removed) in all changes to the source code during a certain period?</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

Question: How many **reviews** to proposed changes to the source code are happening during a certain time period?  

<div>
<table>
  <thead><tr><th>Metric</th><th>Question</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
  <tr><td><a href="https://chaoss.community/metric-reviews">Reviews</a></td><td>What new review requests for changes to the source code occurred during a certain period?</td></tr>
  <tr><td><a href="https://chaoss.community/metric-reviews-accepted">Reviews Accepted</a></td><td>How many accepted reviews are present in a code change?</td></tr>
  <tr><td><a href="https://chaoss.community/metric-reviews-declined">Reviews Declined</a></td><td>What reviews of code changes  ended up declining the change during a certain period?</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

Question: How many **issues** related to the source code are happening during a certain time period?  

<div>
<table>
  <thead><tr><th>Metric</th><th>Question</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
  <tr><td><a href="https://chaoss.community/metric-issues">Issues New</a></td><td>What are the number of new issues created during a certain period?</td></tr>

  <tr><td><a href="https://chaoss.community/metric-issues-closed">Issues Closed</a></td><td>What is the count of issues that were closed during a certain period?</td></tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

**Goal:**  
Efficiency - Learn how effective new code is merged into the code base.  
Question: How efficient is the project in **reviewing** proposed changes to the code, during a certain time period?  

<div>
<table>
  <thead><tr><th>Metric</th><th>Question</th></tr></thead>
<tbody>
  <tr><td><a href="https://chaoss.community/metric-reviews-accepted">Reviews Accepted</a></td><td>How many accepted reviews are present in a code change?</td></tr>
  <tr><td><a href="https://chaoss.community/metric-review-duration">Review Duration</a></td><td>How long are proposed changes reviewed before they are accepted?</td></tr>
