### Community Dashboard

The community dashboard at [chaoss.biterg.io](https://chaoss.biterg.io) is a GrimoireLab instance provided by [Bitergia](https://bitergia.com/). All contributors' information in the CHAOSS project is processed to power the dashboard.

CHAOSS community members can create, save, and share visualizations. This is encouraged in building out metrics within working groups.
