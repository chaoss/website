### Common Metrics

The Common Metrics Working Group focuses on defining the metrics that are used by both working groups or are important for community health, but that do not cleanly fit into one of the other existing working groups. Areas of interest include organizational affiliation, responsiveness, and geographic coverage.

The Common Metrics WG meets every other Thursday at 10:00am CT (usually 17:00 CET, [check your local time](http://arewemeetingyet.com/Chicago/2019-02-21/10:00/b/CHAOSS%20Common%20Metrics%20WG)) via [Zoom](https://zoom.us/j/4998687533) -- [Agenda and Meeting Minutes](https://bit.ly/2ROytFz)
