### Tianyi Zhou

Tianyi Zhou selected for GSoC 2020


#### Project Title

Large Social Network Analysis and Anomaly Detection with Augur.


#### Project Description

Augur is a software that collect data for a list of given repositories and provide a variety of CHAOSS metrics to provides open source health and sustainability metrics.Then users can empirically investigate and uncover useful insights for software engineering, such as understanding the collaborative pattern.

In the current stage, Augur is unable to mining the repositories to generate the co-editing information in the open source software development. This project idea is about to develop this kind of functions to enhance the Augur project. It will end up with a new data worker and analysis tool for fine-grained co-editing network which opens up a massive new source of high-resolution data on human collaboration patterns.

Then I would like to establish the Augur server to mining and monitor the open source ecosystem (with 10000+ repositories or more). The collaboration networks and social trace data of all contributors in the open source ecosystem will be evaluated in terms of social network analysis. It will play a vital role in achieving Augur's goal towards analysis of open source organizations health as well as the goal of the CHAOSS project towards diversity and inclusion.


### Sarit Adhikari

Sarit Adhikari selected for GSoC 2020


#### Project Title

Machine Learning for Anomaly Detection in Open Source Communities


#### Project Description

Open-source software development is a collaborative effort that requires decentralized decision making from different developers and maintainers. In order to measure the progress of the project, It is important to quantify the code changes across time. CHAOSS provides analytics and metrics to help open source communities measure the impact of the developer’s work on the project and the impact of the project on the community. Augur is a prototyped implementation of the CHAOSS Project on open source software metrics which systematically integrates data from several open-source repositories, issue trackers, mailing lists, etc. Anamoly detection is a common data science strategy of finding extreme data points (outliers), whose features differ vastly from other normal data points. From an open-source software development perspective, it detects unusual surges and drops in development activities like code-commits, pull-requests, etc. This project aims to identify the different types of anomalies that are available from trace data and deliver a personalized notification to the user using several machine learning techniques.


### Abhinav Bajpai

Abhinav Bajpai selected for GSoC 2020


#### Project Title

Implementing GitLab Data Collection Worker and Mapper to bind the responses of GitLab API, Github API & the Augur schema.


#### Project Description

The project aims to develop a Gitlab collection worker closely tied up with the Github collection worker using mapper files to bind the intended attributes of their API responses and the Augur schema. Gitlab worker holds the responsibility to fetch progressive data related to Issues, Commits, Merge Requests etc from GitLab using python-gitlab API on which metrics could be generated. Additional modules like Data Setter module and Schema moderator would be implemented to work as a common channel for both the workers to push the collected API response into the Augur Database or to change the Augur schema by editing the mapper files. Data Setter module will additionally hold the responsibility of implementing the duplicate management mechanism.

### vchrombie

vchrombie selected for GSoC 2020


#### Project Title

Creating Quality models using GrimoireLab and CHAOSS metrics.


#### Project Description

GrimoireLab is a powerful open-source platform that provides support for monitoring and in-depth analysis of software projects. It produces a rich set of dashboards, which can be easily inspected by decision-makers to help them understand the evolution and health of their projects. Despite the large set of dashboards available in GrimoireLab, comparing projects between each other is not straightforward since it requires navigating and drilling down the data in different dashboards.

Prosoul is a web application that empowers decision-makers with the means to create and manage their own quality models, which are useful means to evaluate and compare software projects. This project idea is about supporting the definition of Quality Models using GrimoireLab data and Prosoul.

The main aim of the project is to design an approach to shape the GrimoireLab data in a format that can easily be consumed by Prosoul and implement it on the data obtained from a few data sources like git, github and mailing list repositories to obtain simple quality models.

#### Project Title

Support of Source Code Related Metrics.


#### Project Description

Graal produces analysis related to code complexity, quality, dependencies, vulnerability and licensing and the data produced conforms to the ones that can be processed by GrimoireLab. I will mainly be focusing on:

* Adding support of source code related metrics to Grimoirelab with the help of analysis data produced by Graal.
* Adapting Grimoirelab toolchain to be able to execute Graal and process the data produced by it.
* Writing appropriate unit tests for additional backends, their corresponding supporting connectors, and methods.
* Producing analytics related to proposed and calculated metrics* ( described below )
* Adding documentation related to additional features and improvements in existing ones.

Out of all the five backends provided by Graal, CoCom (Code Complexity) covers a vast majority of the popular languages and CoLic (Code License) supported by NOMOS & ScanCode helps us fetch license & copyright related information from software development repositories and is language independent. Addition of metrics related to these two backends during GSoC period could be applied to a wide range of projects in the future.
