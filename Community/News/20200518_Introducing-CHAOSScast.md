# Introducing CHAOSScast

by Georg Link

CHAOSS has come a long way since founded in 2017 and is primed to go much further. Let’s take a look back at our accomplishments of the first three years. 

We now have 6 working groups. We defined and released 40 metrics. We release the GrimoireLab and Augur metrics software. And we organized 5 CHAOSScon community events. 

We have made the CHAOSS community a **vibrant place of activity** that brings together diverse people from across the open source ecosystem who are interested in understanding, measuring, and analyzing open source community health.

**With [CHAOSScast](https://podcast.chaoss.community/), the CHAOSS community is growing even further!**

The goal of the community podcast is to share use cases and experience with measuring open source community health. We want to elevate conversations around metrics, analytics, and software for open source community health. 

The podcast will fill an important gap in the CHAOSS community. We will invite guests to speak about their unique use cases and experiences. These are stories we would have a hard time sharing otherwise.
