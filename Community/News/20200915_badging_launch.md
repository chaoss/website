# Project Launch: CHAOSS Diversity & Inclusion Badging Program

### By Matt Snell

We are so excited to announce that our Diversity & Inclusion Badging Program is up and running. We are currently accepting applications for events, both in-person and virtual. If you are an organizer of an event, consider applying for a CHAOSS D&I Event Badge! You can start the process here: 

https://chaoss.community/diversity-and-inclusion-badging/

Event organizers can apply for a D&I Event Badge for reasons of leadership, self-reflection, and self-improvement on issues critical to fostering more diverse and inclusive events. Our goal is that this program fosters healthier D&I practices in open source and recognizes events that prioritize diversity and inclusivity for all.

The D&I Badging Program would not be where it is without the amazing group of people who have helped make it a reality. Thank you everyone!! :)  

If you are applying for a  D&I Event Badge, we strongly suggest that you submit the application at least two months prior to an event so that we can provide a timely and thoughtful review. Event Badging submissions take place openly and transparently on GitHub, and you can begin the application at our [CHAOSS D&I Badging Applicant form](https://chaoss.community/diversity-and-inclusion-badging/). We are also constantly improving the program, so please request upgrades and send ideas at any of [our repositories](https://github.com/badging).

The D&I Badging Program is also currently accepting new reviewers. If you want to become involved in the D&I Badging Program, please check out the [reviewer guide](https://github.com/badging/event-diversity-and-inclusion/issues/42) to learn more about the role. If you want to help, you can [apply to review](https://forms.gle/xefku3FoeQh31BNg9) today!

**Letâ€™s work together to help improve diversity and inclusion for all!!**
