## CHAOSS DEI V3

It's been a year since the introduction of the CHAOSS DEI (Diversity Equity and Inclusion) badging initiative in the September of 2020, and we are happy to announce the release of CHAOSS DEI V3. This version introduces new and well-defined metrics and improved guidelines for reviewers. The CHAOSS DEI badging Initiative will also be issuing badges to open source projects in this new version.

## About the Initiative

The [CHAOSS DEI Badging Initiative](https://chaoss.community/diversity-and-inclusion-badging/) is an initiative created to foster positive DEI practices in open source by measuring the inclusiveness of different technical events through manual reviews.
This initiative aims to encourage events and open source projects to obtain DEI badges for reasons of leadership, self-reflection, and self-improvement on issues critical to building a healthier open source ecosystem

### Some of the goals we hope to achieve as a team are

- Aligning the badging program with best practices, guidelines and recommendations from Diversity, Equity & Inclusion efforts on the CHAOSS project.
- Establish an environment where projects and events can engage in the badging program
- Building an open, peer-review system for the DEI Badging Program

### Progress Since the Launch

When the DEI Badging Initiative was introduced, it was focused on open source events only. With the committed team of [volunteering professionals](https://chaoss.community/diversity-and-inclusion-badging/) as reviewers, we were able to review and issue DEI badges to over [30 open-source events](https://github.com/badging/event-diversity-and-inclusion).

There are 4 levels existing for the event badging program: the Pending, Passing, Silver and Gold levels. These badges are issued based on the events’ performance on the [metrics for Diversity, Equity and Inclusion](https://github.com/badging/event-diversity-and-inclusion/blob/4cf3db14c4561a64ea632ef1400a7e9070e2ad04/.github/checklist-virtual.md) that are tracked.

## New Features

CHAOSS DEI V3 has come with improved featured metrics to track Diversity, Equity and Inclusion across open source projects and events. Some of the features to expect in the V3 are:

✔️ Web-based form for events to apply for a badge.

In the previous versions, most applications were made using the GitHub application process; providing answers to the metric checks. In V3 we have made a web-based form to enable applicants to simplify and streamline the badging process. This form even details the requirement for every metric question asked, making it easier for applicants to fill out.

✔️ Adding new metrics to the checklists

- **Event Accessibility**

  - **Retention:**
    This metric checks if events incorporate feedback from past events or have a strategy to integrate feedback into future iterations.
  - **Accessibility request:**
    This metric checks if attendees can inquire if accommodations are available and make suggestions for future accommodations.
  - **Session Accessibility:**
    This metric checks if event attendees can access the event platform after the event

- **Family Friendliness:**
  This metric is meant to measure the event’s performance in terms of attendee wellbeing at the event. It tracks if the event has provision for child care facilities and other family-friendly benefits.

✔️ Additions to the reviewer guidelines for checklist editing

The previous version lacked specification on the requirements for becoming a reviewer. Reviewers are critical to the CHAOSS DEI Badging initiative, as they are responsible for closing a Badging application and declaring the final badge for an application. In this version, we have highlighted guidelines and requirements for members who volunteer to become Badge Reviewers.

✔️ Consistent outreach to the Open Source community
Just before the release of V3, we got to talk about Badging at OSS-NA, All Things Open and CHAOSScon. We hope to make every open-source event and organization aware of this initiative and its goals. This means we will be doing a lot more outreach with this new release.

## Join Us

We are hopeful that these metrics and this initiative will be useful to open source event organizers interested in integrating virtual and in-person events into their community-building and engagement strategies.
