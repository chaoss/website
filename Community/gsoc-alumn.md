## Parth Sharma

### Project Title 
Build CHAOSS Risk and Growth Maturity and Decline Metrics in Augur
### Project Description
Augur is fully functional prototyping web stack for CHAOSS metrics. It provides structured data mined from git repositories using a plugin architecture that incorporates other open source metrics projects like Facade and FOSSology. The main aim of this project is to extend Augurâ€™s functionality by implementing Risk and Growth-Maturity-Decline CHAOSS metrics and use cases with a focus on the open source community manager use case. This project, with a focus on the community manager use case, will allow open source community managers to leverage Risk and Growth-Maturity-Decline metrics to better manage their communities and projects.

## Bingwen Ma

### Project Title
Build CHAOSS Risk and Growth Maturity and Decline Metrics in Augur
### Project Description
The project aims are to implement Risk metrics and other metrics within the Growth-Maturity-Decline CHAOSS metrics and use cases using Augur, focusing on what we have unearthed as the open source community manager use case.

## Aniruddha Karajgi

### Project Title
Implementing CHAOSS Metrics with Perceval
### Project Description
The aim of this project is to create reference implementations and tests, primarily for the metrics defined by the Evolution Working Group, but also for the other working groups. This will be done by analyzing the data retrieved by Perceval from various sources using jupyter notebooks, pandas and matplotlib.

## Nishchith K Shetty

### Project Title
Support of Source Code Related Metrics
### Project Description
Graal produces analysis related to code complexity, quality, dependencies, vulnerability and licensing and the data produced conforms to the ones that can be processed by GrimoireLab. I will mainly be focusing on:

* Adding support of source code related metrics to Grimoirelab with the help of analysis data produced by Graal.
* Adapting Grimoirelab toolchain to be able to execute Graal and process the data produced by it.
* Writing appropriate unit tests for additional backends, their corresponding supporting connectors, and methods.
* Producing analytics related to proposed and calculated metrics* ( described below )
* Adding documentation related to additional features and improvements in existing ones.

Out of all the five backends provided by Graal, CoCom (Code Complexity) covers a vast majority of the popular languages and CoLic (Code License) supported by NOMOS & ScanCode helps us fetch license & copyright related information from software development repositories and is language independent. Addition of metrics related to these two backends during GSoC period could be applied to a wide range of projects in the future.

## Pranjal Aswani

### Project Title
Reporting of CHAOSS Metrics: Refactoring the existing code and extending the capabilities of the Manuscripts Project

### Project Description
The Manuscripts project, which is a part of the Grimoire Toolset, helps us in analysing repositories and projects by creating a report based on predefined Metrics which give an overview of the project. The infrastructure of the current report generation system needs to be updated so that the users can spend less time on figuring out the hows and can focus on the functionality. The aim of this project is to extend the capabilities of the Manuscripts project so that it covers almost all the Metrics that can be calculated using the different data sources. At the end of this project, we will have a bigger and better reporting system.
