# Diversity & Inclusion Event Badging Form
Thank you for showing interest in D&I Badging for your event! The Event Badging section of CHAOSS Badging is about measuring inclusivity of different technical events through human reviews.

The goal of the Diversity & Inclusion Badging Program is to encourage events to obtain D&I badges for reasons of leadership, self-reflection, and self-improvement on issues critical to building the Internet as a social good.

### Motivation to Apply 
 
The primary motivation to apply for a CHAOSS D&I Badge is the badge itself! The awarded event can show the open source community that they foster healthy D&I practices with a CHAOSS badge.
