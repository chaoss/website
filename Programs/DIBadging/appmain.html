            <p><strong>Description: </strong>Attendee and Speaker demographics help indicate the potential for different viewpoints and broader perspectives and representation at an event. Because everyone has a different perspective, investigating the responses for each group of demographics can indicate whether people from various demographics feel less included than the average.</p>

            <h2>Inclusive Experience at Event</h2>
            <p><strong>Question: </strong>To what extent does an event organizing team commit to an inclusive experience at an event?</p>
            <p><strong>Description: </strong>Inclusiveness of an event is most impactful when attendees feel included and welcome.

This metric focuses on the work by event organizers and the outcomes from that work on the inclusive experiences of event attendees.</p>

            <h2>Code of Conduct at Event</h2>
            <p><strong>Question: </strong>How does the Code of Conduct for events support diversity and inclusion?</p>
            <p><strong>Description: </strong>A code of conduct describes rules of good behavior between event participants and what avenues are available when someone violates those expected good behaviors. An event with a code of conduct sends the signal that the organizers are willing to respond to incidences, which helps people from all backgrounds feel included and comfortable attending the event. Event participants are empowered to report incidences and proactively help mitigate situations of unwanted behavior.</p>

            <h2>Diversity Access Tickets</h2>
            <p><strong>Question: </strong>How are Diversity Access Tickets used to support diversity and inclusion for an event?</p>
            <p><strong>Description: </strong>Inviting diverse groups of people may be made explicit by offering specific tickets for them. These tickets may be discounted to add further incentive for members of the invited groups to attend. A popular example are reduced tickets for students.<br><br>
              Diversity access tickets can enable community members to attend events and encourage new members to join. Especially unemployed, underemployed, or otherwise economically disadvantaged people may otherwise be excluded from attending an event. Furthermore, diversity access tickets can encourage additional contributions and ongoing contributions.</p>

            <h2>Diversity Access Tickets</h2>
            <p><strong>Question: </strong>How are Diversity Access Tickets used to support diversity and inclusion for an event?</p>
            <p><strong>Description: </strong>Inviting diverse groups of people may be made explicit by offering specific tickets for them. These tickets may be discounted to add further incentive for members of the invited groups to attend. A popular example are reduced tickets for students.<br><br>
              Diversity access tickets can enable community members to attend events and encourage new members to join. Especially unemployed, underemployed, or otherwise economically disadvantaged people may otherwise be excluded from attending an event. Furthermore, diversity access tickets can encourage additional contributions and ongoing contributions.</p>
