# Release History
CHAOSS metrics are released continuously. The regular release is when we update the version number, update the full release notes, and make a big announcement. These releases occur one to two times a year and may correspond with the dates of a CHAOSScon event. Prior to regular release, continuous released metrics go through a comment period of at least 30 days.

    Refactored the "Code Development" focus area into 3 separate focus areas to more closely align with other working groups. Rather than having one broad focus area with multiple subsections, we decided our intent would be better communicated by making each of these subsections into their own focus areas.
    The 3 separate focus areas include:
      - Code Development Activity
      - Code Development Efficiency
      - Code Development Process Quality
  * Kept the other 2 focus areas (Issue Resolution and Community Growth) the same.
  * No major changes were made to already existing metrics.

  * New metrics include:
    - OSI Approved Licenses
    -	Licenses Declared
    -	Test Coverage (Updated)
    -	Elephant Factor
    -	Committers
  * Focused on increasing metrics coverage in the general areas of CNCF Core Infrastructure badging and licensing.
  * License Count was removed from the release. It is being replaced by the Licenses Declared metric.
  * Software Bill of Materials was removed from the release. It is being reworked as the SPDX Document metric for the next release.
- **Value WG**
  * New metrics include:
    - Social Currency Metric System (SCMS)
    - Job Opportunities
  * A new focus area of Ecosystem Value was developed
