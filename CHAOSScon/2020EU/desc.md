## About CHAOSScon
Learn about open source project health metrics and tools used by open source projects, communities, and engineering teams to track and analyze their community work. This conference will provide a venue for discussing open source project health, CHAOSS updates, use cases, and hands-on workshops for developers, community managers, project managers, and anyone interested in measuring open source project health. We will also share insights from the CHAOSS working groups on *Diversity and Inclusion*, *Evolution*, *Risk*, *Value*, and *Common Metrics*.

## Registration

[Registration is now open!](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/chaosscon-europe-2020-tickets-76515900117)

This is the first time we charge a $10 fee for RSVPing to CHAOSScon. We'd like to explain. At CHAOSScon NA 2019, interested people were discouraged from coming because they were on a waitlist but we had many empty seats due to no-shows. By charging a small amount, we hope to limit no-shows. The ticket fee will go towards providing coffee, tee, snacks, and serve lunch. Selected speakers will receive a free ticket. Anyone may request a free diversity access ticket.
