## About CHAOSScon

Learn about open source project health metrics, and tools used by open source projects, communities, and engineering teams to track and analyze their community work. This conference will provide a venue for discussing open source project health, CHAOSS updates, use cases, and hands-on workshops for developers, community managers, project managers, and anyone interested in measuring open source project health. We will also share insights from the CHAOSS working groups on *Diversity and Inclusion*, *Evolution*, *Risk*, *Value*, and *Common Metrics*.
