_PhD Cand. / DevOps - Polytechnique Montreal_

Ph.D. Candidate.,   Software Engineering, MCIS -- Laboratory, École Polytechnique de Montréal.
OpenStack Member Level: Foundation Member.
I am focused on empirical research on ecosystems software releases.  I apply mixed method research as a means to answer both the how and why in my findings, which is beneficiary to both the academic and industrial communities.  I am Using a DevOps approach with machine learning to make crucial decisions. Currently, I am involved with the release team of OpenStack and serving as the PC chair of AI and HPC track, for the submit at Denver 2019. Additionally, I am a Big Data analytics guy.
Before my current experience, I had Worked on interesting software engineering topics for swarms of robots. Moreover, my expertise in cloud computing is an asset, which I bring along. In my thesis, I investigated the phenomena of live migrations and how we can apply both the supervised and reinforced learning technique (Machine learning algorithms) on live migration in the cloud.  
I was part of the team; team lead on an exciting project at LASSENA Laboratory Montreal, Canada. My main task includes building test bench simulator for micro iBB black boxes for cars in other to reconstruct accident scenario to understand driver's behavior.
Currently, I am serving as a Science Judge for Quebec and Canada (Canada-Wide-Science)
Member of IEEE and ACM. [@foundjem](https://twitter.com/foundjem)


> Session: **How to release an open source Ecosystems?**
>
> Software ecosystems bring value by integrating projects related to a given domain, for example, open source projects in a Linux distribution or mobile apps in the Android platform. Since each project has its release cycle and roadmap, having to install compatible versions of each project manually puts an enormous burden on the users, and hence many ecosystems release a polished, well-integrated product to the end user. This paper empirically studies this release synchronization strategy in the context of the OpenStack ecosystem, in which a central release management team manages the six-month release cycle of the overall OpenStack product. By analyzing one year of release team IRC meeting logs, we identified nine major release synchronization activities, which we cataloged and documented. To validate our findings, we interviewed 8 active OpenStack practitioners (members of either the release team or project teams). Our results suggest that even though an ecosystem’s power lies in the interaction of independent projects, release synchronization is a non-trivial goal.

> Session: **Finding Your Focus and Measuring Your Success as a Young OSPO**
>
> When an OSPO is young, it’s especially important to focus on the values, goals, and actions that are most critical. You must also be prepared to measure and prove your progress toward those goals. In this talk, you will hear some tips for choosing the most useful things to focus on at different stages of the first years of your OSPO. You will also think about what questions you need to answer with the data you collect, and how you can prioritize gathering those specific metrics. I will talk about the decisions we made at Indeed regarding which questions to answer, and how to answer them. I will also share some insights about the tools we’ve used & built (including which tools can give you useful metrics with little effort), and how we’re adapting some of our tooling today to answer new questions as we grow and add new initiatives.

> Session: **Two different philosophies on measuring open source project health: Comparing GrimoireLab and CROSSMINER**
>
> Decision makers often face challenges to understand open source projects, especially as data is scattered across different collaboration platforms. Two tools - GrimoireLab and CROSSMINER - were developed to overcome this challenge but were started with different goals in mind. On the one hand, GrimoireLab focused on understanding software development process within open source projects. On the other hand, CROSSMINER focused on helping software developers select the right open source projects. The meaning of project health is different in both cases. This talk is about this philosophical difference in approaching open source project health metrics, how it shaped the tools, what this means for metrics that were implemented, and what lessons can be learned about measuring open source project health.

> Session: **Morality and Ethics in Software: Can it be measured?**
>
> Software drives everything. What drives software is algorithms.  We have been able to measure how "good" or "bad" a piece of  software is by various metrics as done by the Prospector  project. Is there a higher level of consideration around the ethical basis of software and contrasting that with the morality of software and algorithms.   How should developers be driven when it comes to crafting ethical solutions if the morality of the developer is  challenged and vice versa? Is there an absolute moral code for developers? Ethical codes are crafted in many professions but there aren't moral codes. Is that an oversight.  This talk will explore the nuances of ethics and morals  and propose some mental strategies in navigating these. It is not meant to be exhaustive nor definitive. There does not seem to be much by way of research in this field and one of the outcomes of this talk is to trigger the discussion and potentially finding a way to quantify, measure and  perhaps act on being ethical and moral in software development.

> Session: **Implementing CII Best Practice Metrics & What it Really Means**
>
> This presentation is to explain the process of implementing the CII Best Practices API as a risk metric and a brief discussion of its implications. I will start with a program that performs a basic API call to CII. Next, I will examine the API call and explain some important parameters. Then, I will ask for some feedback on other parameters that may be useful. A combination of the predetermined metrics and audience suggestions will be used to create a CII dashboard. If we are short on time, example code will be ready to be used in the place of written code. I will end the presentation with a brief discussion with the audience, exploring potential use cases and implications of the CII Best Practices metric.

> Session: **What do all these metrics tell us about our communities?**
>
> There are plenty of metrics available to measure various aspects of your community ranging from contributors, contributors’ activities, followers on social media, event attendees, etc. However, what exactly are these metrics telling us and do they always tell the same story?   Metrics (and numbers in general) can give people a false sense of clarity and even worse, people can draw wrong conclusions from metrics when they lack proper context. So how and when should metrics be used?   In this session, Ray will discuss how metrics are used at GitLab to assess support for community members across different phases of the contributor journey.  Ray will also discuss how community metrics at GitLab has evolved over time and how it needs to continue to evolve as the GitLab community grows.

> Session: **Keynote: Strategy and Data for Open Source Growth**
>
> Data is key to informing a strategy. Over the last twenty years, open source projects have collected data to track and measure project and community growth.  As more enterprise developers have engaged in open source, companies have used this data to support different business models. How has the data and tools evolved, and what are successful projects, communities and companies measuring to inform strategies.
