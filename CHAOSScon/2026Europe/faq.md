### Where can I find information about venue and event accessibility?

This information is on the [CHAOSScon EU home page](https://chaoss.community/chaosscon-2026-eu/).

### Do you provide discounts or free tickets for students or others?

Although we always strive to keep CHAOSScons as afforable as possible, we understand that costs can still be prohibitive. Thanks to our friends at [OLS](https://we-are-ols.org/), we have a small amount of Diversity Access Tickets available for anyone who would like to attend but cannot afford to do so.  Please reach out to the [CHAOSS Community Manager, Elizabeth Barron](mailto:elizabeth@chaoss.community), for more information on how to obtain one of these tickets.

### How can I connect with others attending the conference?

The CHAOSS Community primarily interacts through [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/chaoss-workspace/shared_invite/zt-35ir7w0jr-aiwTPYShbj~mMsMbzhGWWQ). If you'd like to connect with other attendees either before, during, or after the conference, our [#chaosscon channel](https://chaoss-workspace.slack.com/archives/C02EMK6RAKT) would be the place! We will also use this channel to communicate any changes in schedule or any other news during the conference itself.
