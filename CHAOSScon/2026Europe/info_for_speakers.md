## A/V Information

The venue has a simple AV system. Speakers can bring a laptop to connect to a screen in most rooms. Two of the smaller rooms have tables to sit around and a screen to connect to. One smaller room has only chairs and no technology. Great for unconference sessions. Only the Ostrom room (main stage) has a microphone and will be live-streamed.
