### 🎟️ Registration

There are two ticket levels for this year's CHAOSScon:

#### CHAOSScon EU 2026: €40.00 
This ticket gives you full access to CHAOSScon. You can attend all talks, panels, and interactive sessions throughout the day. 

This year's ticket also includes lunch, coffee and snacks, and the evening social event, as well as access to dedicated rooms for hands-on and small group discussions, which is something we've not provided in years past. We are excited about this new format!

#### CHAOSScon EU 2026 + Open Source Village: €121.00
This ticket includes everything in the CHAOSScon EU ticket, plus access to *all* Open Source Village Events happening in the Commons Hub for the two week period surrounding FOSDEM.

This is a combined ticket that offers a 33% savings compared to buying the CHAOSScon and Open Source Village tickets separately, while giving you a broader open source experience beyond just the conference day. To learn more about these events, visit https://opensourcevillage.org/.
