**What is Digital Sovereignty and Where Do I Start?**

Digital sovereignty has been getting more attention in recent years. However, little is
said about where to start and how to implement it. In this talk, we will look at some
examples of the role of free software today in this process and some existing initiatives
at the European level.

This naturally leads to the crucial question of community sustainability and software to
measure the health of open-source projects that underpin our digital infrastructure.

In addition, we will look at some data on the inherent risks of its use and real-world
examples. Do we really want digital sovereignty? Probably not. Perhaps what we are really
seeking is technological independence.

**Understanding Community Health of Published Research Software with Augur**

CHAOSS recommends comparing metrics for many projects you are familiar with to assess open
source health and sustainability, but newcomers are frequently uncertain about which
projects to compare their own projects to. This is an especially significant problem for
research, academic, and non-government organizational (NGO) projects, as they typically
have different patterns of engagement when compared to Linux Foundation and other
corporatized open source projects. In this work, we illustrate how to bridge this gap by
using Augur to analyze the community health of ~3200 software packages that have been
peer-reviewed and published by the Journal of Open Source Software, which represent a
class of research software: that which is intended to be shared community software and for
which the developers seek scholarly credit.


### David Lippert

the impact of open source software on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN
SDGs).

#### 1:25 in Ostrom Room 

**Keynote: Discovering and measuring the impact and health of Digital Public Goods**

Digital Public Goods (DPGs) are a subset of open source projects focused on helping to
achieve the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  In this talk we
will detail how the CHAOSS community is building tools, processes, and standards to enable
open source projects to be identified as DPGs.  The official DPG registry includes open
source software and open data projects including DHIS2, Drupal, Fedora Linux, LibreOffice,
Mastodon, Open Sustainable Technology, OpenStreetMap, Wikipedia, and many more.  We
believe there are tens of thousands or more open source projects that qualify as DPGs and
we are creating a simple process so maintainers can ensure their projects get the
recognition they deserve.

During our session we will give a quick background of the CHAOSS UN SDG working group as
well as give a demo of our tool to enable maintainers to quickly identify which SDGs their
project is ""highly relevant"" at addressing.  We will also discuss the DPG Alliance and
their DPG Project Registry.  Finally, we will walk through the latest DPGScore report
created by the Code4GovTech team.  Throughout this talk we will explore which CHAOSS
metrics are important for measuring the health of DPGs.

**Welcome: Demonstrating Organizational Value for Open Source
  Efforts**

Demonstrating the value of your open source efforts can be a challenge for OSPOs and
open source teams. The new CHAOSS Demonstrating Value Practitioner Guide shows how this
can be done by using a combination of criticality and project health risk to prioritize
your open source work. By demonstrating to internal leaders the value of their open
source engagements, OSPOs and open source teams are in a much better position to receive
the resources needed to sustain those efforts long-term. 

Every organization has unique needs and goals based on what they are trying to achieve,
so there is no “one size fits all” way of demonstrating value. This talk will help you
think about how your open source work helps your organization achieve its goals and will
help you frame and communicate that value in ways that resonate with your leadership
team.

**Maintainer Arc: Lessons from a first time maintainer**

Desmond Obisi shares his journey stepping into the role of first-time maintainer for the
open-source project BadgingAPI. What began as writing code evolved into shaping the
project’s health, building community engagement, and steering long-term sustainability
through hands-on decisions.

In the presentation he outlines the initial challenges of becoming a maintainer:
establishing onboarding practices, defining contributor roles, managing submissions,
aligning documentation, and fostering an inclusive culture. He explains how he selected,
monitored, and interpreted critical community-health indicators such as contributor
activity, responsiveness to issues and pull requests, newcomer retention, and
participation across regions. The talk also examines contextual influences that shaped the
journey, including varying connectivity, local contributor pipelines, mentorship
strategies, and the retention of contributors from under-represented regions.

Desmond discusses what worked well and what remained difficult. He offers practical advice
aimed at new maintainers and project teams, particularly those from under-represented
regions on how to adopt community-health metrics early, build sustainable contributor
pathways, and avoid common pitfalls.

**Building Sustainable Open Source Health Ecosystems in Emerging Markets**

Abubakar Hassanat examines how Open Source principles can be leveraged to strengthen
healthcare innovation and sustainability in emerging markets. With a background in
healthcare and a passion for open source, Hassanat has led the development of two
impactful health solutions—Consuelo, a free mental health support platform for Nigerians,
and Mycyster, a health-tracking tool that helps women with PCOS manage their health and
lifestyle.

Drawing from these experiences, Hassanat explores the unique opportunities and constraints
shaping open source health ecosystems in sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in her home
country, Nigeria. While global discussions on open source sustainability often focus on
resource-rich contexts, projects in emerging markets face distinct challenges such as
limited funding, healthcare infrastructure gaps, and low digital literacy.

This talk proposes a contextual sustainability framework that extends CHAOSS community
health metrics with new indicators relevant to emerging regions, including local capacity
building, accessibility impact, cross-sector partnerships, and policy alignment. Through
real-world case studies, Hassanat demonstrates how open collaboration can bridge public
health gaps, foster inclusivity, and democratize access to digital healthcare innovation
while ensuring long-term community health.

**Can a Badge Save a Project? Rethinking Sustainability through Community Metrics**

What if the true sign of a sustainable open source project wasn’t just stars or
contributors, but how it treats its community? This session explores how the CHAOSS DEI
Project Badging initiative helps open source maintainers and contributors measure and
improve community health. Project Badging focuses on four key metrics: Project Access,
Newcomer Experience, Inclusive Leadership, and Communication Transparency.

Attendees will learn how these areas can help boost contributor retention and create
safer, more inclusive spaces. You’ll leave with practical steps for applying for a CHAOSS
badge and ideas for embedding DEI into your project’s core practices. Whether you’re part
of a small open-source effort or a larger organization, this talk offers a people-first
approach to building resilient, secure, and sustainable digital infrastructure.

to becoming one of the defining pillars in the CHAOSS project. This talk will highlight
how the CHAOSS Design team, through consistent collaboration and intentional leadership,
transformed how contributors experience and participate in community-driven projects. From
shaping the CHAOSS Badging initiative web project that celebrates contributor diversity
and inclusion, to redesigning the Augur interface for better data storytelling, and
building a cohesive CHAOSS Brand System. Each milestone reflects the growing maturity of

**Panel: Funding in OSS**

Models for funding projects has been changing over time.  It used to be that companies and
organizations would hire maintainers and also fund foundation sponsorships for projects
they cared about.  With changing budgets and employee requirements, the mix of how a
company funds open source work is changing.  I want to discuss a model that I am exploring
to get feedback and hear form others on their mental model for funding open source work.

Dr. Sebastian Neumaier is a Senior Researcher at the University of Applied Sciences St.
Pölten (Austria), where his research centers on data ecosystems, open-source software
quality, and knowledge graph technologies. He currently leads several funded projects,
including CrOSSD and the Horizon Europe project CERTAIN, advancing open science and
data-driven innovation.

#### 11:10 in Ostrom Room

**CrOSSD - Towards a Critical Open-Source Software Database**

The CrOSSD project (https://crossd.tech/) presents a comprehensive system for monitoring
and evaluating the health and quality of open source software (OSS) projects. In this
talk, Sebastian Neumaier and Tobias Dam will introduce the project’s interdisciplinary
research approach, which combines empirical software engineering, data science, and
qualitative research to better understand and quantify OSS community health.

CrOSSD is built on three main pillars: 

1. Based on the work of CHAOSS, our goal is to operationalize metrics that capture both
   technical and social dimensions of OSS quality.
2. We develop a platform (https://health.crossd.tech/) that regularly collects data from
   diverse repositories and applies these metrics to assess project health over time. We
   provide a web-based platform and API that allow users to explore, compare, and analyze
   these OSS health assessments interactively. 
3. In addition to the technical implementation, our presentation will highlight insights
   from over twenty stakeholder interviews conducted with developers, maintainers, and
   ecosystem participants. These interviews reveal how practitioners perceive key concepts
   such as project criticality, sustainability, and trust in OSS components. 

By combining automated evaluation with qualitative perspectives, CrOSSD aims to contribute
to more transparent, data-driven decision-making in open source adoption and governance.

#### 11:40 in Ostrom Room 

**Raising Open Leaders: Measuring How Mentorship Sustains Open Source Communities**

Open source communities thrive when contributors evolve into mentors and mentors grow into
leaders. Yet, most measures of project health still focus on code activity — commits, pull
requests, and issue closures — while overlooking the human infrastructure that keeps
communities alive.

This talk explores mentorship as a vital but often invisible health metric in open source.
Drawing on experiences from Outreachy, Public Lab, and other contributor ecosystems, I’ll
share how structured mentorship models prevent burnout, strengthen contributor retention,
and create leadership pipelines that sustain communities over time.

We’ll examine how existing CHAOSS metrics like contributor growth, engagement, and
responsiveness can be expanded to reflect mentorship relationships, knowledge transfer,
and inclusion. Through case studies and real data from mentorship programs, I’ll
demonstrate how tracking mentorship outcomes offers a more holistic picture of community
health and long-term sustainability.

By reframing mentorship from an informal practice into a measurable indicator, we can
recognize the unseen work that builds resilient, inclusive open source ecosystems, and
raise the next generation of open leaders.
