<details><summary><b>Session: Open Source newbie experience on the CHAOSS Project</b></summary>
I would like to share my open source experience with CHAOSS project during the Contributhon 2022. An initiative by  SheCodeAfrica to introduce more women to open source contribution. The program introduced me  to open source contribution and I was able to settle in and collaborate with others to build a bot for the CHAOSS Project. The bot welcomes and directs new users to the CHAOSS Community on slack; before the bot project,  individuals had to welcome and give directions to new members.
The program was a life changing experience that has impacted positively on my skills. There are lots of people out there who really don’t know how to go about contributing to open source and programs that can introduce them to open source contributions  are  really important for the open source ecosystem.
This presentation will provide a holistic view of:
- Contributing to open source as a newbie.
- Highlight experience and knowledge gained.

[@kayleachampion](https://twitter.com/kayleachampion)  

Kaylea Champion is a PhD Candidate in Communication at University of Washington. She studies how people cooperate to build public goods like GNU/Linux and Wikipedia, including what gets built and maintained -- and what doesn't. Prior to graduate school, she worked in IT as a consultant, system administrator and project manager. She holds an MS in Computer Science from the University of Chicago. A Linux user since 1994, she enjoys tromping through the woods, smashing goblins, and cooking for a crowd.

<details><summary><b>Session: All the Bugs Belong to Me? Collaboration Networks and Project Health</b></summary>
What can our collaboration networks tell us about the health of our projects? From the spread of innovation to the spread of disease, the field of social network analysis has examined a dizzying array of interactions and framed them as a network. As we work together to solve problems in software, our collaboration effort can also be described as forming a network as well. In this talk, Kaylea applies network analysis ideas to the world of open source. This unlocks powerful tools for analyzing collaboration at scale. She'll be reporting results of her research to understand the relationship between collaboration network structure and whether a project is thriving or barely surviving.

<br>_Researcher - Queen's University_  
[@foundjem](https://twitter.com/foundjem)  

A Mixed-method researcher (Ph.D.) with interests in the intersection of software ecosystem sustainability and Human-centered design/A.I., release engineering (DevOps --AI/ML), software engineering for ML Applications, mining massive software repositories and datasets to find patterns and make predictions, software evolution and maintenance, empirical software engineering, edge/cloud computing, and human-computer interaction. Skills in robotics and Big data analytics. Affiliated to MCIS laboratory and advised by Prof. Bram Adams.

<details><summary><b>Session: Growing a sustainable software ecosystem, a socio-technical perspective</b></summary>
This talk focuses on the socio-technical collaboration among multiple contributors, which is natural in distributed open-source software development processes. In particular, this phenomenon is known as micro-collaboration practices, in which numerous authors contribute to the same commitment. To support micro-collaboration practice, GitLab and GitHub started supporting social coding mechanisms such as the Co-Authored-By: trailers in commit messages, which, in turn, enable the study of such micro-collaboration empirically. This talk provides an epitome case study of collaboration practices in popular open-source ecosystems such as the  OpenStack ecosystem to understand micro-collaboration mechanisms, their benefits, and constraints. Thus, this talk analyzed over 1,804 OpenStack project repositories over nine-year and claimed that micro-collaboration code practice facilitates contributors to grow a sustainable ecosystem.

<details><summary><b>Session: Collaboration as a Key Health Indicator for OSS Communities</b></summary>
Open source communities are people. Participants, contributors, and users are some of the roles that we already know and we have acknowledged some of them in the existing CHAOSS work.
The very existence of public profiles developing software with whom you can interact, make decisions together, and discuss next steps is important up to the point that the alternative is to have close governance communities with low interaction and lack of initiative.

Some OSS foundations and OSS projects (not all of them I can say) are indeed stating the importance of these other artifacts as key to a good open governance policy (as for instance the Four Opens by the Open Infrastructure Foundation) and having those discussions in a transparent, public and open way is part of their culture.

How can this be translated into CHAOSS terminology? Collaboration. And how can we measure collaboration? This is the question. This talk aims at providing an initial set of existing use cases where collaboration is used as a metric of a healthy community, an initial list of metrics related to the collaboration concept that we can standardize within CHAOSS, and some existing CHAOSS-related [GrimoireLab] collaboration visualizations.

As specific CHAOSS output for this discussion, I’d like to see this part of future work of some of the existing working groups and hopefully, add them as part of the next metric discussions.

<details><summary><b>Session: Sustainability: Tips on Building a Healthy Open Source Community</b></summary>
The success of an Open Source community depends on how healthy the Community is. Hence, It is important when building the right community should be the topmost priority of any open-source organization. It helps achieve a healthy community where the members have equal inclusion.

We often think of a successful open source project as one that just tackles a challenge for the public. This perception has driven several open source project owners to start innovative open source projects without any plans on how to manage the community behind this project. In the end, increasing the number of dormant open source projects already existing. A successful open source project is one that is built on the collaborative effort of a healthy community. A properly coordinated community can plan and build projects and unanimously work together to ensure sustainable project performance. The responsibility of achieving a successful open source community does not rest on the community managers or the program managers alone but also on the whole community. During this session, I will be sharing;

1. How you can accept and implement feedback from members
2. How to give feedback to the community.
3. Improve the onboarding process for your new Contributors
4. The importance of community first approach in Open Source Community and a lot more.

<details><summary><b>Session: Creating a grocery store of metrics and models</b></summary>
This lightning talk is about how CHAOSS presents metrics and models using the metaphor of a grocery store. A grocery store manager decides on a layout of aisles, including where and how to present food in a way that people find the ingredients for their cooking. In CHAOSS’s case, we need to present metrics in a way that people find the right metrics and models for understanding their community. Similar to how foods have nutrition labels, CHAOSS wrote metric definitions and that helps decide which metric to use. Initiatives and use cases for metrics are comparable to recipes and meal planning. Using this metaphor, this lightning talk aims to help us rethink how we are presenting, sharing, and making metrics available.

<details><summary><b>Session: Building Bridges With Badges: How Metrics Help You Find the Right Crowd</b></summary>
People like to see a shiny sticker! Does a "Best of" badge on an event ad make you more interested in attending?

Badges are important for attracting talent resources. For events and projects, they signal values that help potential volunteers determine their interest. Time is valuable; people only participate in the projects they believe in. Badges help safeguard this talent.  

There is no "one true way," but there are best practices for using badges! Badges help showcase that leaders actively monitor metrics related to practices that impact potential contributors and attendees. Both events and projects can show their health and dedication to excellence by obtaining recognition from a respected organization..  How do you know which badges to apply for, or what each badge means to potential volunteers/contributors?

The CHAOSS Badging Project offers the DEI Event Badge, which represents an event's dedication to healthy diversity, equity, and inclusion practices. CHAOSS will be launching a project badging initiative that will also give open source projects a similar opportunity to display their dedication to DEI best practices. Join us as we look at how badges like this, and the metrics they capture, can attract the volunteers and contributors necessary to make your project or event more successful.

<details><summary><b>Session: Sifting through the noise: behavior change or broken machine?</b></summary>
Data collected around open source projects is notoriously messy, and sometimes it just doesn’t smell right. So - how can you tell if you are looking at noise or erratic human behavior? When talking to every contributor is not an option, analysts must take systematic approaches to verify and interpret results. This talk will discuss examples of confusing or nonsensical values collected in the pursuit of project health, and the steps taken to investigate the accuracy of the results.
