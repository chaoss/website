_Researcher and Software Developer - Bitergia_

Software engineer at Bitergia and analytics team member. After finishing his PhD on web page representation for clustering tasks in 2012, he has been working in projects involving data retrieval and analysis from different data sources. He has experience with Java, Spring, Python, MySQL, Apache Solr and ElasticSearch, among others. Apart from implementing metrics with Python and Kibana and according to his close family, he is interested in too many things to write a list here.

Session: **Creating a Collection of Panels**

> During the last months, we have been dealing with dozens of panels and its number keeps increasing. It is expected to have many more, and it is becoming hard to deal with this amount of information. We need to scale!
>
> The concept of collections of panels aims at bringing some order into the existing repository. A panel collection is just a set of Kibana dashboards. In this case, each panel is a Kibana dashboard consisting of a set of widgets.
>
> GrimoireLab CHAOSS GMD code development metrics is an example where this concept can be applied. What about having a collection of GMD panels? This would be based on publicly available and could be built on top of GrimoreLab, so anyone can deploy the panels and get them working for their own purposes.
>
> We will show the collection built on top real data, retrieved and processed by means of GrimoireLab projects. From that point, we will take a walk on the panels offering a closer look at the metrics. Looking at real numbers ease to get a deeper understanding of the metrics, as we can see them in action.

Session: **Your Team’s Open Source Contributions, in One Dashboard**
> With the rise of Open Source Program Offices in the industry, we are observing a rise in teams dedicated to upstream open source contributions. As this often represents the result of a large investment from a company, it is important to be able to quantify and monitor the team’s contributions over time. To answer this, we created a tool that tracks the open source contributions from a list of users. The tool uses Perceval and the GitHub API to track pull requests, issues, comments, reviews, commits authored, and commits merged. The dashboard then displays a summary of the team’s contributions, any user’s contributions as well as a series of charts.

Session: **A Tale of Metrics Faux Pas: Answers Without Questions**

> We all recognize that metrics are key to measuring community health. And that quantitative data is a key to these metrics. But, as Brian Proffitt will describe in this talk, all the data in the world won't help you find answers if you don't know what the questions are. Brian will walk attendees through what happens when pretty data can distract from the real purpose of metrics.

Session: **Keynote 2: Finding the Order in the Chaos(s) of Metrics: Are We There Yet?**

> We often ask ourselves and look around in our environments, wondering if our actions and activities are up to standards and efficient enough or if there is room for improvement. Measuring efficiency, modeling health with numbers, and creating dashboards have been part of our lives for a long time now, but do we do it in the right way? Are we abusing the numbers or are we looking at accurate pictures at all times?
>
> The CHAOSS project was created to help navigating the chaos of metrics. CHAOSS exists to help understand the purpose of numbers and KPI’s and to understand the dynamics and health of our environments -- corporate and open source.
>
> This presentation will give you an overview about the importance and danger of metrics with some anecdotes and the work the CHAOSS project is doing. You will learn about the working groups as well as get a picture about the status of software components designed and developed by the community.

Session: **Hack Days...???...Profit**

> There are three types of metrics: metrics, damned metrics, and KPIs.
>
> Community health metrics, like any other data, are all about interpretation and perspective. The goal of this talk is to enable you to get your own point across to decision makers by using the numbers game.
>
> Marketing budgets even within small companies are typically *well over* 500,000 USD while less expensive and more effective ways to marketing are disregarded. This talk explains the difference between marketing, developer advocacy, community management, and how you can convince your boss to let you and developers around you be more autonomous to increase business performance.
>
> This translates to voluntary hack days, travelling to at least 1-2 conferences per year, and increasing the awareness for your company in a smarter way than a clickable blocked ad on the internet can. Number crunching and KPIs for each section included.

Session: **Graal: Get the Knowledge Out of Your Code**

> Source code contains plenty of information useful derive insightful metrics about your software project. Such an information can be extracted with source code analysis tools. however, they do not often come with features to support incremental analysis. Furthermore they generally lack of support to combine their results with other analysis tools or relate them with other software project data (e.g., bugs, pull requests).
>
> This lighting talk presents Graal, an open source tool that helps you to collect data from your source code in an easy and consistent way, and offers the results in a flexible JSON format, useful to ease the bridging with analysis and/or visualization tools. Graal relies on a a customizable and incremental approach that allows combining and manipulating the output of existing source code analysis tools.
>
> Graal leverages on Perceval, that simplifies the collection of project data by covering more than 30 well-known tools and platforms related to contributing to open source development. Graal shares with Perceval the same output format, which enables you to combine together all your software project data to define cross-cutting analytics. Perceval and Graal are fully open source and part of GrimoireLab, a popular platform to define software development analytics for your project. GrimoireLab is developed by Bitergia and it is one of the assets of the CHAOSS project of the Linux Foundation.

Session: **SortingHat: Managing Contributor Identities in your Software Project**

> Contributors of open source projects rely on a plethora of tools (e.g., Git, Slack, GitHub) to coordinate and support development-related activities. Such tools often provide authentication mechanisms that require a combination of an email, an username and a full name. Thus, the same contributor may end up having different identities on the tools he is working on. In a scenario where you want to check the contributions of an individual in your project, you may face a difficult nut to crack. What to do then? Of course, you may develop ad-hoc scripts or perform manual work to merge identities, or you can use SortingHat.
>
> SortingHat helps you to track contributor identities and their related information such as gender, country and organization enrollments. It allows you to manipulate identities interactively as well as to load them via batch files (useful for projects with large communities). SortingHat functionalities can also be used through Hatstall, which provides a handy graphical interface for non-technical users. In this talk you will see how easy is to manage contributor identities and how to empower your project with analytics focused on individual contributions.

> SortingHat and HatStall are two components of GrimoireLab, an industry strong open source platform developed by Bitergia, which offers commercial software analytics and is part of the CHAOSS project of the Linux Foundation.
