My Journey into Open Source and Why You Belong Here Too


**Talk abstract:**


It's less than a year in I started contributing to open source, I know I have a lot to learn but I am already here. I now know I don't need to write code to contribute to open source and I want to share my open source story, and inspire other non code professionals.
This talk shares how I went from newcomer to contributor, the strategies and people who made it possible, and why every newcomer belong here too. 

It also highlights how open source isn’t about years of experience, but also about open doors, and how inclusion and accessibility played a huge role.

Metrics and the Business of Open Source


**Talk abstract:**


The value of communities around open source projects has long been known as one of the best aspects of building new things, like software, hardware, and art. Collaboration and innovation simply explode exponentially when communities work together towards common goals. But how does that translate to business? Corporations, and even non-profit foundations, need to see the value of the work done on paper. So how does that work? In this talk, Brian Proffitt will outline the ways that Red Hat is attempting to do just that.

Outsourcing AI Data Annotation and ML with Open Source Tools


**Talk abstract:**


In the AI lifecycle, quality data is as critical as intelligent code. Yet, while machine learning often grabs the spotlight, data annotation remains the hidden foundation. For open source AI to thrive, we must address the data bottleneck - ethically, efficiently, and inclusively.

This talk proposes a transformative approach: outsourcing AI data annotation and model training workflows using open source tools like Label Studio, CVAT, and Doccano. We’ll explore how projects and organizations can:

1. Build sustainable pipelines without vendor lock-in

2. Leverage global, diverse annotator communities

3. Apply open governance to data workflows

4. Ensure transparency, reproducibility, and model accountability

**Talk Title:**
Passion Put to Work: Building Africa’s Cloud Native Community


**Talk abstract:**


Several years ago, I sat in an Andela Bootcamp interview and heard a question that changed my trajectory: “Are you passionate?” Of course, I said yes. But then came the follow-up: “How have you put that passion to work?” I paused. I hadn’t—not meaningfully. That moment lit a fire in me, one that’s fueled everything since.

Before I became a CNCF Ambassador, I was simply a DevOps engineer who stumbled upon Kubernetes and fell in love with its elegant complexity. But love alone wasn’t enough—I had to do the work. I set out on a mission: to champion Cloud Native adoption, development, and growth across Africa.

When I took over leadership of the Cloud Native Community in Lagos, it was quiet—almost forgotten. But with a small team of passionate builders, we revived it. Today, it’s the largest Cloud Native community on the continent. But we didn’t stop there. We built bridges—with people, with organizations, with purpose.

One such bridge was again, Andela. While we ran CNCF Lagos KCNA Bootcamps, he led internal Kubernetes sessions. I reached out. We collaborated. And when Andela returned from KubeCon + CloudNativeCon London 2025, they came back with a vision—and a partnership—that would train 20,000–30,000 people in Cloud Native foundations.

Pre-seeds: Cultivating Research Skills for Underrepresented Voices in Africa


**Talk abstract:**


Research is the backbone of innovation, yet many aspiring researchers in Africa remain locked out due to systemic barriers such as limited access to training, lack of mentorship, and resource constraints. Pre-seeds (Research 101) is an open-source, beginner-friendly research course designed to equip underrepresented individuals with foundational research skills, preparing them for research-oriented careers, including PhDs.

To ensure the course directly addresses the needs of underrepresented researchers, we conducted a survey across diverse African communities to identify gaps in existing research training programs. Insights from the survey are shaping our modular course structure, covering everything from formulating research questions to data analysis, ethics, and publishing research.

We are currently in the process of creating these course modules and will launch a pilot cohort this year, iterating based on learner feedback. The course will be freely accessible under a Creative Commons license, ensuring anyone, anywhere can learn and contribute. We welcome global collaborators, mentors, and contributors to help shape this initiative and expand its impact.

Beyond academia, Pre-seeds also introduces research software engineering and citizen science as avenues for contributing to the global body of knowledge. This ensures that individuals who may not pursue a PhD can still engage meaningfully in open research and open science.

Yak Shaving in the Open: When Doing the Work Isn’t the Work


**Talk abstract:**

As a product manager who has worked in several product teams across different digital domains, I have learned that forward momentum often loses to good intentions.
In open source product teams (especially those driven by passion and volunteer energy), it’s easy to fall into a rabbit hole of tasks that seem important but don’t move the product forward. 
This is known as yak shaving. It starts with a small, focused goal and ends with someone rewriting a toolchain, commit, or plugin they never planned to touch.

This talk explores how yak shaving shows up in open source development, how to recognise it early, and how to keep your team focused on delivering meaningful value instead of endlessly preparing to.

Understanding and Scaling your OSS Project with git-metrics


**Talk abstract:**

As repos grow and with the rise of AI-generated code, hidden risks can disrupt developer workflows. This talk introduces git-metrics, an open-source tool for holistic repo health analysis. We'll take a practical tour, using Git commands and low-level object analysis to track historic growth, show contributor dynamics, etc. By the end of this talk developers and maintainers will have learned how to make informed decisions to manage their repos and see how these metrics can power an AI agent for intelligent, proactive suggestions on repository management.
