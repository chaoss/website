## About CHAOSS Shanghai Meetup

Meet the CHAOSS community. Learn about metrics and tools used by several open source projects, communities, and engineering teams to track and analyze their development activities, communities health, diversity, risk, and value.

If you are interested in learning more about open source and innersource community health, and how this can be measured and tracked over time, weâ€™d love for you to join the Community Health Analytics Open Source Software (CHAOSS) community for an evening of lively conversation, breakout sessions, and several video presentations.

This event is open to anyone interested in participating in an interactive discussion about community health metrics, and no open source coding experience is required.

The event is free to attend, but registration is required. Food and drinks will be provided.
