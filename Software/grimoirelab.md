# GrimoireLab

GrimoireLab is a set of free, open source software tools for software development analytics. They gather data from several platforms involved in software development (Git, GitHub, Jira, Bugzilla, Gerrit, Mailing lists, Jenkins, Slack, Discourse, Confluence, StackOverflow, [and more](https://chaoss.github.io/grimoirelab/)), merge and organize it in a database, and produce visualizations, actionable dashboards, and analytics of all of it.  

GrimoireLab is focused on analyzing activity, community, and processes. Nonetheless, it can be easily tailored for other aims, and integrated with other tools.
